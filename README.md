# Swindon Data Project

This repository contains scripts and notebooks used for the analysis of Swindon data. 

I make no guarantees that the code is efficient or perfect but hopefully it will evolve!

## Swindon COVID-19 Data
### Contents

Currently there are two Jupyter Notebooks which are viewable from the Github interface:

1. Deaths Comparison
2. Infection Comparison

The first of these compares death data retrieved from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the second compares infection data retrieved from the Local Government Association.

Both notebooks compare the following local authorities:

* Swindon
* Wiltshire
* Cheltenham
* Northampton

Swindon is the are of interest, Wiltshire is chosen as it's intwined with Swindon both socially, economically and environmentally. Northampton has a similar population and roughly the same demographics as Swindon. Cheltenham however was chosen out of intrigue and with no scientific reasoning.
